# Taskr on SOL
Taskr is a web application built with NextJS and [Anchor](https://www.anchor.so/), along with a smart contract on the Solana blockchain. 

The main idea is to have projects with tasks, when creating projects users stake a certain amount of SOL, when a task is completed the amount is returned back to the user. A concept of POW link in the task can be implemented in the future so that users can prove they actually did the task.

Deployment: https://taskr.alk.pw/<br>
Contract Deployed on `tbYd4CYZMmfY53sQvxWkmShy1WDyYF4RPAPvVUUAmtu` on Devnet <br>
